Hey Kent –
Here is the HW from TWC. Please send back ASAP (by tomorrow 11AM) – do not overthink this test.
 
1. Write a function that takes three sides of a triangle and answers if it's equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

2. For a single-linked (forward only) list write a function that returns 5th element from the end of the list. The list can only be walked once (reverse, length, or size of this list cannot be used).

3. Given two lists, write a function that answers if all elements of one list are in the other. 

Requirements: All questions should have supporting unit tests and project file (maven, sbt, leiningen, gradle, etc.) to run. No external dependencies except testing framework (junit, scalatest, etc.), we should be able to unzip, download, or clone from external repo the source code, build, and run the unit tests. 

This should all be done in Java
